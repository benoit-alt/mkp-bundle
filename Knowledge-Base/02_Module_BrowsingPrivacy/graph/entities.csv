urn:entity:browsing:architecture:vpn_then_tor,Mechanism,VPN-then-Tor Configuration,"User connects to commercial VPN then uses Tor Browser through the tunnel. ISP sees VPN; VPN provider sees Tor guard IPs; Tor guard sees VPN server IP."
urn:entity:browsing:architecture:tor_then_vpn,Mechanism,Tor-then-VPN Configuration,"User connects to Tor then VPN inside Tor circuit. ISP sees Tor usage; VPN provider sees destinations but not user real IP; sites see VPN IP not Tor exit."
urn:entity:browsing:architecture:commercial_tor_vpn,Mechanism,Commercial Tor-Mode VPN,"VPN products advertising Onion-over-VPN or Tor mode. Architectures vary and are often poorly documented; Tor Project warns against relying on such modes."

urn:entity:browsing:technology:vpn_kill_switch,Control,VPN Kill Switch,"Mechanism to block all non-VPN traffic if VPN tunnel drops. Prevents real IP exposure during VPN failure. Effectiveness varies by implementation."
urn:entity:browsing:defense:wtf_pad,Control,WTF-PAD (Adaptive Padding),"Tor circuit/link padding defense. Framework shipped in Tor but no default state machines enabled. Originally cut classic WF to near-random; later DF achieves ~90% accuracy against it."
urn:entity:browsing:defense:walkie_talkie,Control,Walkie-Talkie (Half-Duplex Shaping),"Application-layer half-duplex traffic shaping. Research prototype. Constrains DF to ~49.7% closed-world accuracy near theoretical 50% bound but degrades UX."
urn:entity:browsing:defense:tamaraw,Control,Tamaraw (Fixed-Rate Padding),"Fixed-rate direction-specific padding defense. Bandwidth overhead can exceed 100%. Not deployed in Tor core. Strong but prohibitively expensive for large-scale use."
urn:entity:browsing:defense:detorrent,Control,DeTorrent (Adversarial Padding),"Adversarial padding-only defense via pluggable transport. Reduces WF attacker accuracy by ~61.5% relative to undefended Tor. Leading practical candidate."

urn:entity:browsing:defense:tor_connection_padding,Control,Tor Connection-Level Padding,"Deployed in Tor. Adds ~69 KB per one-time connection. Negligible latency. Not WF-specific; reduces resolution of per-flow netflow data."
urn:entity:browsing:defense:tor_circuit_padding,Control,Tor Circuit-Level Padding Machines,"Deployed for onion services since vanguards. State-machine based. Targeted hardening not comprehensive WF protection."
urn:entity:browsing:attack:deep_fingerprinting,Mechanism,Deep Fingerprinting (DF),"CNN-based website fingerprinting attack. ~98% closed-world accuracy on undefended Tor; ~90% against WTF-PAD in curated datasets."
