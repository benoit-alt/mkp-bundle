<!-- Part of MKP Claude integration pack v1.0.2 – update here, then re-export the pack. -->
# Claude Project Context — Modular Knowledge Platform (MKP)

- Aggregated-first (`./Knowledge-Base/aggregated`), Standard‑12 predicates, URN rules.
- Delegate heavy MKP questions to the **mkp-analyst** subagent (repo-root WD `./`, read-only).
- Use `/mkp-audit` to validate & load; use `/mkp-task` for structured analysis.
